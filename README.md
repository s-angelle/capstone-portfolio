# Portfolio Site

This is a capstone project for "The 2024 Complete Web Development Camp" instructed by Angela Yu.

## Project Goals

The purpose of this site is to encorporate everything reviewed / learned about the front-end so far: HTML, CSS, responsive web design, as well as the Bootstrap framework. This site is to be completely responsive across multiple devices and showcase skills gained (without JavaScript).
