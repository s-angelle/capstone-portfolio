This is a capstone project for "The 2024 Complete Web Development Camp" instructed by Angela Yu.

## Project Goals

The purpose of this site is to incorporate everything reviewed / learned about the front-end so far: HTML, CSS, responsive web design, as well as the Bootstrap framework. This site is to be completely responsive across multiple devices and showcase skills gained **(without JavaScript)**.

### Stretch Goal

1. Implement JavaScript to improve the user's experience, particularly with the hamburger menu that appears for smaller screen resolutions.
